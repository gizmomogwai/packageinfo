* Packageinfo for dlangs dub packages
Sooner or later the question of licenses of dependencies comes
up. This package helps keeping an overview. See [[https://forum.dlang.org/post/t9d7t1$1ljo$1@digitalmars.com][forum.dlang.org/Learn]]
for discussion of this.

** Usage
Please add the following to your artifact (after =dub fetch packageinfo=).
#+BEGIN_SRC dub.sdl
  preGenerateCommands "$DUB run packageinfo"
  sourcePaths "source" "out/generated/packageinfo"
  importPaths "source" "out/generated/packageinfo"
#+END_SRC
This will create a module in out/generated/packageinfo/packageinfo.d
that contains all dependencies with selected informatiosn (name,
version and license).

The information is provided as an enum, so it is possible to
access it at compile time
#+BEGIN_SRC d
import packageinfo;
static foreach (p; packageinfo.packages)
{
    pragma(msg, p);
}
#+END_SRC
or runtime
#+BEGIN_SRC d
import std.stdio : writeln;
import packageinfo;
writeln(packageinfo.packages);
#+END_SRC
